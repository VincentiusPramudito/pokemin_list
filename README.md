# pokemon_list

This web just a simple web about Pokemon Card.
I use some library like jquery, bootstrap, sweetalert2, and API browser like web component. This web was developed just for learning purpose.

1. Npm install to install all dependencies
2. Npm run start-dev to running web on development mode
3. Npm run build to create production code
4. You can use http-server ./dist to start running production code
